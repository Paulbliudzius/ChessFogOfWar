# Chess: Fog of War (Dark Chess)

A chess game with the adaption of Fog of War. You can only see the spaces on the gameboard that are moveable by your pieces. This creates for a completely different playing strategy than the original chess game. Developed in 3D to add an additional visual appeal. Open-source, feel free to collaborate!

## Development Screenshots
April 11, 2015: Very early in development. No unique pieces or sides. Currently getting the classes established for sides (player and opponent). Spaces were removed to be as an example of how the game will just be missing spaces to act as the fog since that space is not visible.

April 12, 2015: Added a border to help recognize when a space would be missing on the board. The pieces are moved sporatically and no pieces were moved just to show the ability to move a piece to any space clicked. There is also added shapes to help indicate the differences in pieces as the classes have been completed and seperated.

May 4, 2015: Eveything should be working on one side of the game (not fully tested). Buttons added to allow one side of the game to be played, development for multiplayer to come soon. The board now only shows available spaces as well as only lets pieces to move legally. Also took some time to develop more recognizable pieces. Color to be added soon to tell teams.
